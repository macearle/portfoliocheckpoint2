		<p>Welcome to the official website for Alpha Chi Omega Sorority 
            at the University of Michigan.</p>

		<p>Alpha Chi Omega was founded in 1885 at Depauw University in Indiana. 
        Check out our national headquarters <a href = "https://www.alphachiomega.org/">website</a> . 
        Here at the University of Michigan we are the Theta Chapter. We create experiences to grow into
        real, strong women every single day. We cherish all of the memories we make together to support our sisters as leaders and champions of change. Love in the bond!</p>
