			<p>Our national philanthropy is Domestic Violence Awareness (DVA). Locally, at our Theta Chapter we support the Women's Center of
        	Southeastern Michigan to fund and donate feminine hygeine products for DV victims. We also educate our members on the importance of 
        	healthy relationships in all aspects of life. Some of our events include restaurant partnerships, pancake or hot chocolate bars at the house 
        	to donate proceeds to the Women's Center, and creating care packages for the women. Our chapter really values coming together to support DVA and 
        	define love in a healthy way, and promote healthy family and romantic relationships, along with friendships.</p>
